JOGridView
==========

This is a grid view based on the concepts that UITableView set forth to provide.

- A cell is one portion of a grid
- Cells are re-usable
- The grid is defined by rows and columns
- Rows have individually settable heights
- Column widths are limited to the equal distribution amongst all columns in a row
- There is no selection at this moment.
- It automatically purges reusable cells when there is a memory constrain
